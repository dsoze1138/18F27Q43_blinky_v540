# PIC18F27Q43 pic-as(v2.20) assembly language blinky project
============================================================

This is a MPLABX v5.40 sample project to show a pic-as(v2.20) 
project and debug method that mostly works.

For short example of work flow see the Windows video file: 

docs/18F27Q43_blinky.wmv

This method is far from ideal but it works better than 
the workaround suggested by the Microchip tools developers.
